# Challenge Outline

The below defines the individual challenges, along with their abstract (goal), any requirements, and their expected outcomes.

## Overview
The **Well-Architected Framework OpenHack** attempts to test the participants' understanding of the Microsoft Well-Architected pillars. During the OpenHack, participants will demonstrate and practice a standardized process of delivering a Well-Architected Assessment across all five of its pillars.

The **Well-Architected Framework OpenHack** simulates a real-world scenario of a bank who has attempted to deploy a production workload to Azure.  Unfortunately, the bank was unaware of the Well-Architected pillars and proven design patterns, therefore, the production workload fails in many areas.

During the "hacking," attendees will focus on:
1) Analyzing and identifying enhancements to the customer's environment
2) Strengthening the customer's operational landscape
3) Ensuring that the customer's experience with the Microsoft cloud is of the utmost quality, value, and excellence

By the end of the OpenHack, it is expected that attendees will be familiar with the Well-Architected Framework and able to conduct an assessment against a customer's workload in the Azure cloud.

## Business Outcomes
When conducting a Well-Architected Assessment, Cloud Solution Architects (CSAs) will follow the  standardized process outlined below. This standard process is designed to drive an expected, high-level business value to the customer and to Microsoft. By participating in this OpenHack, CSAs will:

- [ ] Perform detailed analysis of customer workloads within the Well-Architected Framework.  
- [ ] Solidify and demonstrate the knowledge of each pillar of the Well-Architected Framework.  
- [ ] Demonstrate the ability to follow the standardized process of technical assessments while maintaining expected quality and rigor.  
- [ ] Recognize the benefits of applying any pillar of the Well-Architected Framework against a customer's environment.  
- [ ] Identify the value of a wholistic application of the Well-Architected Framework against a customer's environment.  
- [ ] Deliver appropriate recommendations across all pillars of the Well-Architected Framework.  
- [ ] Accelerate and build their own technical intensity.
